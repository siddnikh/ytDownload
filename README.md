Built using MoviePy and PyTube

All you have to do is, run the Python Script in your Terminal, with the YouTube video link, and the desired resolution of that very video. If the resolution isn't available for that video, the program will terminate itself.

##Usage:
''' 
python main.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v65-RkxYVUY 480p
'''

The video will be saved in a folder called 'files' in your present directory, and will be in .mp4 format.
I did this script for fun and to practice xD which probably justifies why this isn't fast. But anyway, this keeps you from disgusting ads on third party websites, and just.. has a nice feel to it xD

Please report if you come across any issues :)
